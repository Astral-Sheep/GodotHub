# GodotHub
Like Unity hub but for Godot.

It's supposed to be a project and version manager, but I plan to add more features in the future.

## Getting Godot Hub

You can either get the executable, or get the source code and export it with Godot 4.0. Since I can't export on Mac, you'll have to go for the second option if you want it on this platform.
